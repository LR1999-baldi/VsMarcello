week 2 story
You feel so good after trolling Marcello. When you get back home, you decide to browse GameBanana for FNF mods because why the hell not. Then you find out about this mod called "Vs. Dave and Bambi", so you play it.
After beating Dave week, you play Bambi week. Then you realize, Bambi sounds just like that one Marcello guy you trolled yesterday. Suddenly, you receive a DM on Discord from this weird guy with a Baldi pfp. He sent you a link to
this game called "Marcello's Fun House!". You click on the link (Remember, don't click links from people you don't know!), then you download the file. You run the executable, and suddenly, you get sucked in. Oh noes! This is just like
that one time when Daddy Dearest trapped you in a game in Week 6! You are greeted by some guy who looks like Bambi/Mr. Bambi.

week 3 story
You want to troll Marcello again, but he has blocked you from his house! So there's only one thing you can do. Travel into the real world and locate his coordinates! Oh wait, you could just get someone else to break into his house. But
that would be boring! You want the satisfaction of trolling him yourself! (making more later)

week 4
What is this? Why is Pico dressed up as Marcello's old character, Marcelo? I don't fucking know! This week wasn't meant to have a story! This week was made to reference a thing a dev made before Marking Chaos's development!
